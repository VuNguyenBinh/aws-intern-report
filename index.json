	"content": "DevSecOps Pipeline Overview (GitLab → AWS) Pipeline goals: Automate the entire build process – security scanning – error notification. Detect bugs and security vulnerabilities early as soon as dev commits code. Create a closed DevSecOps loop: Commit → Scan → Notify → Fix → Commit again.\nFlow summary: Dev commits code to GitLab (main branch). AWS CodePipeline receives events and triggers the pipeline. CodeBuild runs Sonar Scanner to analyze the source code. SonarQube on EC2 receives scan results from Scanner. SonarQube sends Webhook → API Gateway → Lambda. Lambda processes data → sends notification via SNS → dev email. Dev receives bug report → Fix → Commit → go back to loop. The system ensures: Automate security testing. Improve source code quality. Reduce security risks and logic errors. "

	"content": "Understanding the UK Critical Third Parties (CTPs) Regime: What Customers Need to Know On November 12, 2024, the UK financial services regulators — the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — published the final documents for the UK Critical Third Parties (CTPs) regime. These documents clarify how the regime will be implemented and expand regulatory oversight to specific services that designated CTPs provide to the UK financial sector.\nAWS is preparing to comply with this regime, assuming it will be designated as a CTP.\nKey Regulatory Changes Two core documents define the regime:\nSupervisory Statement (SS) 6/24 Critical Third Parties Instrument The Instrument sets the mandatory requirements for designated CTPs, while SS6/24 provides guidance on interpreting and implementing those requirements. Together, they form the operational foundation for the new supervisory approach.\nWhat the Regime Introduces One of the most significant updates is the introduction of Systemic Third-Party Services (STPS) — services whose disruption could threaten the stability or confidence of the UK financial system.\nDesignated CTPs must meet detailed requirements for STPS, including:\nConducting scenario testing Running incident management playbook exercises Sharing relevant information with regulators The regime becomes effective 1 January 2025, but will only apply after a provider is formally designated. The designation process will take at least six months, with the first designations expected around mid-2025.\nOnce designated, a CTP has three months to submit its first self-assessment report on STPS compliance.\nThe regulatory approach is aligned with international standards and ensures interoperability with other jurisdictions.\nOverall Objective of the Regime The regime aims to address systemic third-party concentration risk — the risk that a small number of external providers supply critical services to many financial institutions.\nIt builds on existing expectations set out in:\nSS1/21 SS2/21 The Operational Resilience policy statement These documents shape how financial institutions manage outsourcing, third-party risk, and impact tolerances for important business services.\nAWS Commitment This outcomes-based regime provides CTPs with flexibility in how they demonstrate compliance. It does not increase the regulatory burden on financial institutions, but supports a stronger, more resilient UK financial system.\nAWS fully supports the regulators’ objectives and values the continued engagement throughout this process. We are committed to:\nMeeting all regulatory requirements Helping customers understand AWS’s approach to the CTP regime Supporting customers in improving their operational resilience Impact on Customers Regulators have clarified that the regime does not remove or reduce the responsibilities of financial institutions, their boards, or senior management.\nImportantly, it does not impose new obligations directly on AWS customers.\nHowever, customers should expect to:\nProvide accurate information about their third-party dependencies Review and update their risk management and due-diligence processes Leverage new information shared by CTPs under the regime AWS already provides a wide range of services that support effective incident management, across both cloud-native and hybrid environments.\nGuidance on incident management is also available in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.\nIf you have questions about the regime or operational resilience practices — including incident management — contact your AWS account team.\nAbout the Authors Michael Jefferson Michael Jefferson is the Head of Public Policy for Financial Services at AWS, covering the UK, Middle East, Africa, and Switzerland. He co-leads AWS\u0026rsquo;s engagement with the Financial Stability Board (FSB). His background spans technology, industry associations, investment banking, and the UK public sector.\nArvind Kannan Arvind Kannan is a Principal Compliance Specialist at AWS based in London. He works closely with financial services customers across EMEA, focusing on governance, risk, compliance, and operational resilience, helping them navigate increasingly complex regulatory expectations.\n"

	"content": "This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:\nBlog 1 - What Customers Need to Know About Critical Third Parties (CTPs) in the UK The UK Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime establishes a robust framework to oversee third-party services critical to the stability and trust of the financial system. It defines Systemic Third-Party Services (STPS), sets clear expectations for testing, incident management, and regulatory reporting, and aligns with international standards for operational resilience.\nWhile the regime does not impose direct obligations on financial institutions’ customers, it emphasizes accurate reporting and transparency to enable regulators to identify and manage risks effectively. AWS supports this outcomes-based framework and remains committed to helping customers enhance operational resilience through guidance, tools, and cloud-based services.\nOverall, the CTP regime strengthens the UK financial sector by reducing systemic third-party concentration risks and promoting a more resilient, well-managed infrastructure.\nBlog 2 - The SOC 1 Winter 2024 report by AWS The SOC 1 Winter 2024 report by AWS provides comprehensive assurance for 183 services over the full year of 2024, reflecting AWS’s continued commitment to meeting stringent compliance and security standards. By making the report accessible through AWS Artifact, customers can easily verify AWS’s compliance status and integrate this information into their own audit and risk management processes.\nAWS continues to expand its compliance programs to support customers across industries, ensuring that security, privacy, and operational requirements are met. The SOC 1 report underscores AWS’s dedication to transparency, customer trust, and effective governance, enabling organizations to rely on AWS services with confidence.\nBlog 3 - Sharing the vision of a more connected world with AWS IoT AWS IoT continues to drive innovation and deliver tailored, verticalized solutions across industries, enabling customers to achieve specific business outcomes through connected devices, digital twins, smart cities, and connected vehicles. By leveraging a broad suite of cloud and edge services, along with a strong partner ecosystem, AWS simplifies IoT adoption, ensures scalability, and enhances operational efficiency.\nThe IoT strategy at AWS focuses on understanding customer challenges, providing prebuilt solutions, and integrating AI, machine learning, and analytics to unlock data and optimize processes. Across sectors such as industrial, retail, commercial buildings, transportation, and robotics, AWS IoT empowers organizations to increase productivity, improve sustainability, and create new value.

Perform container image and dependency scanning using Trivy, helping to detect vulnerabilities in libraries and base images. Run Bandit to check for security issues in Python/JavaScript code. Integrate SonarQube to evaluate code quality (code smells, duplication, coverage, maintainability\u0026hellip;). Push important findings to AWS Security Hub to centrally manage security alerts. Send real-time notifications (via Email/SNS/Chat\u0026hellip;) when detecting serious problems for the development team to handle promptly.\nContent Workshop overview Pipline flow Sonarqube analysis Lambda and notification Close loop devsecops "

	"content": "Overall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future? Any other comments (free sharing): "
